==== Breaking Changes
- Add support for OTel data stream routing by parsing `data_stream.dataset` and `data_stream.namespace` from resource attributes, instrumentation scope attributes, and signal-level attributes (in increasing order of precedence). This is a breaking change only if the data_stream fields are currently used in OTel attributes, since they are now parsed for routing and no longer stored as labels. {pull}12578[12578]
